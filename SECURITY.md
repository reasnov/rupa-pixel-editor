# Security Policy: Protecting the Café

The security of the **Rupa Pixel Editor** and the privacy of our baristas are of utmost importance. The system operates under the **3S (Secure, Sustain, Scalable)** protocol, ensuring a resilient and trustworthy studio environment.

## 🛡️ 3S Security Protocol (S1)

Rupa adheres to strict security standards to protect user data and system integrity:

- **Zero-Trust Boundaries**: All external data (project files, palettes, images) is treated as untrusted and validated before processing.
- **Environment Isolation**: Native file system access is brokered through a secure IPC bridge, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Input Sanitization**: User-provided strings (project names, layer names) are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

## 📦 Supported Versions

We currently provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| v0.2.x  | ✅ Yes    |
| < v0.2  | ❌ No     |
