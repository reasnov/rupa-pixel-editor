# The Artisan's User Guide: Weaving in Rupa

Welcome to your studio. This guide provides the knowledge needed to master the **Rupa Pixel Editor**, transforming your keyboard into a digital loom.

---

## 1. Entering the Atelier (The Workspace)

Rupa uses a professional container-based layout to maximize your creative focus:

- **Atelier Header (Top):** Your command center. Houses the project name, core tools, and the **Audio Basin** trigger.
- **Folio Sidebar (Left):** Navigasi project hierarchy. Manage your **Frames** (Pages) and **Veils** (Layers) here. You can reorder them via drag-and-drop or shortcuts.
- **Inspector Sidebar (Right):** Precision tools. Access the **Dye Inspector**, the full **Dye Palette**, and real-time **Needle Stats**.
- **TechLedger (Bottom):** A slim bar showing your current working time, chord history, and the **Atmosphere Protocol** status.

---

## 2. Core Navigation & Stitching

Rupa is designed for a keyboard-first experience.

### 2.1 Moving the Needle

- **Arrow Keys:** Move the Needle across the linen.
- **`G` (Go To):** Instantly jump to a specific coordinate.
- **`F1`:** Open the **Artisan Codex** for deep study.

### 2.2 Applying Dyes (Stitching)

- **Space / Enter:** Apply the active dye to the current cell (Stitch).
- **Backspace / Delete:** Clear the current cell (Unstitch).
- **Number Keys (1-0):** Select threads from the palette. Each selection plays a note in the **C Major Scale**.

## 3. The Artisan's Stances (Modes)

| Stance          | Modifier       | Action                                                                          |
| :-------------- | :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Resting**     | None           | Free movement without altering the linen.                                       |
| **Threading**   | `Ctrl`         | **Flow-Stitch:** Color every cell the needle passes through.                    |
| **Looming**     | `Shift`        | **Selection:** Define a rectangular area. The selection persists until cleared. |
| **Unravelling** | `Ctrl + Shift` | **Flow-Erase:** Clear every cell the needle passes through.                     |
| **Picking**     | `Alt`          | **Eyedropper:** Sample a color directly from the linen.                         |

## 4. Layering & Reordering (Veils)

The studio supports unlimited depth through **Veils**.

- **`[` (Left Bracket):** Move active veil up (towards Foreground).
- **`]` (Right Bracket):** Move active veil down (towards Background).
- **`Alt+H`:** Toggle veil visibility.
- **`Alt+L`:** Toggle veil lock.

---

## 5. Atmosphere Protocol (Ambient Music)

The Atelier rewards deep focus. The studio is silent for the first **30 minutes** of your session. After this period, a generative piano melody will begin to weave into your workspace, reaching its full resonant volume at the **60-minute** mark.

You can tune the volumes of both the **Piano (BGM)** and **Stitch Resonance (SFX)** in the **Audio Basin** (`Ctrl+Shift+A`).

---

## 6. Pattern Manipulation (Selection)

When you define a selection (Looming), it remains active as a **Persistent Selection** (shown with a thin gray border) even after releasing Shift.

- **`Space`:** Fill the selection with the active dye.
- **`Ctrl + C` (Copy):** Capture the **Motif** (pattern) into the clipboard as a **Swatch**.
- **`Ctrl + X` (Cut):** Capture the Swatch and clear the source area.
- **`Ctrl + V` (Paste):** Place the captured Swatch at the current needle position.
- **`Esc`:** Clear the active selection.

---

## 5. Viewport Control (Loom Zoom)

- **`+` / `=`:** Zoom in for fine detail.
- **`-`:** Zoom out to see the whole tapestry.
- **`0`:** Reset zoom to 100%.

The camera protocol ensures the **Needle** always stays centered in your view when zooming.

---

## 6. Creating Artifacts (Export)

When your work is complete, transform it into a permanent file:

1. Press **`Ctrl + E`** to open the **Artifact Crate**.
2. Choose your format:
   - **PNG:** A sharp, pixel-perfect raster image.
   - **SVG:** An optimized vector graphic. The engine intelligently merges connected stitches into complex paths, keeping the file size small.
3. Select your scale and background preference.
4. Export and save to your local system.

---

## 7. Archiving Patterns (Saving)

- **`Ctrl + S`:** Save your project as a `.rupa` Pattern Book.
- **Linen Backup:** Rupa automatically backs up your work every 10 minutes.
