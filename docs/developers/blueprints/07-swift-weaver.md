# Blueprint 07: The Swift Barista (Geometric Precision)

## 1. Executive Summary

This blueprint defines the transition from manual pixel placement to geometric-assisted brewing. It focuses on reducing physical fatigue through intelligent path correction and batch rendering.

---

## 2. Terminology & Core Modes

Rupa operates in two distinct operational states:

1. **Pixel Mode** (The Still Weave): Focused on pixel-perfect static images and patterns. Now enhanced with **Quick Shape Correction**.
2. **Kinetic Mode** (The Moving Weave): Focused on the temporal sequence of frames and motion.

### 3.1 Advanced Rendering

| Technical Term    | Barista Term               | Action                                                         |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **QuickShape**    | **Quick Shape Correction** | Hold pointer to snap rough paths into perfect geometric forms. |
| **Batch Fill**    | **Atomic Pixel**          | Fill all pixels in a stroke simultaneously on release.         |
| **Interpolation** | **Fiber Flow**             | Seamless pixel connectivity via Bresenham's algorithm.         |

## 4. Implementation Success (v0.6.0)

1. **FiberEngine Integration**: Centralized all pixel math into the new Logic Layer.
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Implemented SVG-based marching ants for zero-lag visual tracking.
3. **Inclusive Foundation**: Standardized i18n and A11y across all barista tools.
