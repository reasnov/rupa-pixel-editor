# Development Blueprints

This directory contains the technical blueprints that have guided the development of the **Rupa Pixel Editor**. These documents serve as both historical records and ongoing contracts for implementation.

## 🗺 Blueprint Index

### [01: Project Genesis](./01-project-genesis.md)
