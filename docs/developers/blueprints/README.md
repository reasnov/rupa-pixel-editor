# Development Blueprints

This directory contains the technical blueprints that have guided the development of **Rupa Pixel Editor**. These documents serve as both historical records and ongoing contracts for implementation.

## 🗺 Blueprint Index

### [01: Core Architecture](./01-core-architecture.md)

_The foundational contract: Repository structure, technology stack, and core protocols._

### [02: Palette & Export Engine](./02-palette-and-export.md)

_Expanding to color: Palette management, viewport zooming, and the export engine (SVG/PNG)._

### [03: Persistence & Manipulation](./03-persistence-and-manipulation.md)

_The shift to a professional workspace: Project file format, auto-backups, and grid manipulation._

### [04: Input Engine](./04-input-engine.md)

_The nervous system: Intent-based input, chord parsing, and context sovereignty._

### [05: Mode Orchestration](./05-mode-orchestration.md)

_Behavioral orchestration: Managing modes (Paint, Select, Erase) and synchronization._

_Multi-frame and multi-layer orchestration: Managing complex projects and hierarchical data._

### [07: Geometric Logic](./07-geometric-logic.md)

_Efficiency and automation: Flood fill, smart selection, and mathematical assistance._

### [08: Timeline System](./08-timeline-system.md)

_Bringing pixels to life: Timeline management, onion skinning, and animation playback._

### [09: Advanced Drawing Tools](./09-advanced-drawing-tools.md)

_The Master Etcher's Kit: Brushes, symmetry, tiling, and shape vessels._

### [10: Industrial Scale Performance](./10-industrial-scale-performance.md)

_Scale and speed: Optimized rendering, color caching, and large-project handling._
