# Release Notes: v0.1.0 (Genesis)

This is the initial pre-release of **Rupa Pixel Editor**, establishing the foundational "Digital Pixeling" engine and keyboard-centric workflow.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Svelte 5 & Electron Integration**: Leveraging the power of Svelte 5 Runes for ultra-responsive grid management within a native desktop environment.
- **Keyboard-Centric Engine**: Full navigation and drawing controls via arrow keys, designed for maximum precision and flow.
- **Pixel-Flow Mode**: Innovative drawing mechanism that allows continuous coloring by holding `Shift` while navigating.
- **Synthesized SFX**: Programmatic audio feedback for every action (Move, Pixel, Unpixel), creating a tactile digital experience.
- **History System**: Complete Undo/Redo support for up to 500 actions.

## 🛠 Technical Foundation

- **Architecture**: SvelteKit with `adapter-static` serving as the Electron renderer.
- **State**: Centralized reactive state using `$state` and `$derived` runes.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0 for a high-contrast, pixel-perfect UI.
- **Logic**: Pure TypeScript core for coordinate transformations and command-pattern history.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Window resizing does not yet scale the grid dynamically (planned for v0.2.0).
- Palette is currently locked to Black and White.
