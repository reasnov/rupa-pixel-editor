## 2. Key Features & Enhancements

### 2.1 The Selective Harvest (Layer-Based Export)

Creating specialized asset sheets is now faster than ever.

- **Export Selected Layers:** Directly export only the currently selected layers (or groups) as a single composite artifact.
- **Group Support:** Selecting a **Layer Group** automatically includes all child layers in the export, maintaining perfect visual alignment.
- **Rapid Assets:** Ideal for generating separate character parts or UI elements from a single frame workspace.

### 2.2 Pigment Station Precision (v2.0)

Color management has been rebuilt for surgical accuracy and ease of use.

- **High-Precision HSLA:** Removed aggressive rounding in color conversions. Dark shades (like `#0F172A`) now retain their exact values without shifting.
- **8-Char RGBA Standard:** The editor now consistently utilizes 8-character HEX codes (including Alpha) across all inputs and displays.
- **Instant Flow:** Improved the input field with immediate reaktivitas and **Enter-to-Confirm** logic.
- **A11y-Sorted Palettes:** The darkest color in any palette is now automatically moved to the first slot (**Palette 1**) for consistent outlining and accessibility.

### 2.3 UX & Ergonomic Polish

- **Seamless Atmosphere Activation:** Audio (SFX and Ambience) now activates automatically on your very first interaction with the editor. This solves browser-level audio restrictions without requiring any intrusive buttons or "Enter" screens, keeping the artistic flow uninterrupted.
- **Independent Scrollable Export:** The Export Dialog now features separate scroll areas for the Live Preview and Settings columns, ensuring the preview is always visible.
- **Visual Status Cues:** Active tools in the sidebar now have a distinct "pressed" look with a gold accent and indicator dot.
- **Smarter Recovery:** Session recovery now activates if you have custom palettes, protecting your color research even if the canvas is empty.
- **Cleaner Labels:** Integrated Title Case formatting for all palette names in the library (e.g., "Sanctuary Nature").

## 3. Engineering Baseline

- **Validation:** All color logic unit tests have been updated to the new RGBA 8-character uppercase standard.
- **Dependency Integrity:** Maintained a zero-external-dependency policy for core pixel math.
