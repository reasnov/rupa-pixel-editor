# Release Notes: v0.10.1 - The Ergonomic Sanctuary Update

**v0.10.1** focuses on structural integrity, ergonomic refinement, and workflow fluidity. This update solidifies the **Global Canvas Standard**, ensuring that every frame and layer in your project breathes the same dimensions, while introducing smart tools to make workspace adjustments effortless.

## 🏗️ Structural Sovereignty

### Global Canvas Dimensions
The project's dimensions are now centralized. Changing the canvas size in **Settings** now uniformly resizes every frame and layer in the project, preserving the alignment of your work across the entire timeline. No more drifting pixels between frames.

### Smart Persistence
Project dimensions are now properly serialized into `.rupa` files. Your sanctuary's proportions are preserved perfectly across sessions, ensuring that what you save is exactly what you load.

## 🛠️ Tools & Precision

### Smart Math Inputs
The **Sanctuary Settings** now support arithmetic expressions in dimension fields. You can now perform quick calculations like `32*2` or `16+8` directly in the width and height inputs.

### Aspect Ratio Lock (🔒)
Maintain your project's proportions with the new **Ratio Lock**. When active, adjusting one dimension automatically calculates and updates the other, keeping your composition consistent.

### Layer-Aware Clipboard
The **CUT**, **COPY**, and **PASTE** operations are now strictly layer-aware. 
- **Copy/Cut** now harvests pixels only from the active layer.
- **Paste** now merges data seamlessly into the current layer and tracks the entire operation in the **History Stack (Undo/Redo)**.

## ⌨️ Artisan's Rhythm (Shortcuts)

### Enhanced Shortcut Discovery
The **Shortcuts** panel has been rebuilt for speed:
- **Autofocused Search**: Start typing the moment you open the guide.
- **Full-Width Clarity**: A refined, spacious search interface to find your rhythms faster.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Keybindings have been audited and standardized. We now use industry-standard `.` (Period) and `,` (Comma) for intuitive timeline navigation.

### Symmetry Cycle
The shortcut for cycling symmetry modes has been moved to **`y`** to avoid proximity conflicts with system-level paste and transformation keys.

## 🎨 Aesthetic & UI

### Unified Background Presets
The **Settings** dialog now includes quick-access buttons for **Canvas Cream (#fdf6e3)** and **Canvas Dark (#121412)**, matching the themes found in the Export menu.

### i18n Resilience
Fixed multiple "Missing Translation Key" warnings. The translation engine is now more robust, ensuring that status notifications like "Canvas Dimensions Adjusted" appear with artisan clarity.
