# Release Notes: v0.2.0 (The Artisan's Workshop)

This release focuses on expanding the editor's capabilities beyond the foundational grid, introducing powerful color management, export tools, and a refined visual identity.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Atelier Color Picker**: A new, keyboard-driven color selection system. Change colors on the fly with precise control over your palette.
- **The Artisan Bloom**: Redesigned cursor using transparent inversion technology (`backdrop-filter`). It remains perfectly visible against any color while maintaining a delicate, non-intrusive aesthetic.
- **Export Engine**: Support for high-quality exports. Save your work as sharp **PNG** or optimized **SVG** with intelligent path merging.
- **Command Palette**: A centralized hub for all editor commands, enabling a truly mouse-free experience.
- **Advanced State Management**: Refined Svelte 5 logic for smoother performance and more robust history tracking.

## 🛠 Improvements

- **Visual Polish**: Updated "Artisan" theme with improved Solarized colors and paper textures.
- **Font Rendering**: Fixed asset paths for EB Garamond and Lora, ensuring a beautiful typographic experience.
- **Cursor Intelligence**: The cursor now hides automatically after 20 seconds of inactivity to let you admire your work.
- **Architecture Docs**: Introduced comprehensive technical documentation for developers at `docs/developers/architecture.md`.

## ⚙️ Technical Changes

- **SVG Optimization**: Implemented a recursive rect-merging algorithm for SVG exports to reduce file size.
- **Asset Serving**: Migrated font paths to root-relative URLs for better SvelteKit/Vite compatibility.
- **Cleanup**: Removed legacy "solid-core" cursor elements in favor of the pure inversion bloom.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Window resizing logic is still being tuned for ultra-wide displays.
- Shortcut conflicts on certain non-QWERTY keyboard layouts.
