# Release Notes: v0.2.1 (The Polished Shuttle)

This patch release focuses on refining the brand identity, improving asset delivery for web deployments, and standardizing the studio's color palette.

## 🚀 Highlights

- **Barista Magenta Identity**: Formally adopted `#D33682` as the core brand color across all UI elements and the Splash Screen.
- **Tiny5 Typography**: Integrated a specialized pixel-art font for brand headings, creating a more cohesive "Retro-Barista" aesthetic.
- **Harmonized Palette**: Redesigned the 10 default "threads" based on a Solarized-inspired color system for better visual harmony.
- **Web-Ready Infrastructure**: Fixed critical asset loading issues on GitHub Pages by implementing `.nojekyll` and migrating fonts to Vite-managed directories.

## 🛠 Improvements

- **Centered Identity**: Refined the `README.md` with centered logos and a direct link to the Live Demo.
- **Dynamic Versioning**: The UI and Splash Screen now pull the version string directly from the build system, ensuring zero-latency synchronization.
- **Cursor Clarity**: Finalized the removal of solid-core elements in favor of the pure "Barista Bengine" inversion.
- **Deployment Reliability**: Fixed the `npm run deploy` script with `--dotfiles` support and resolved `publint` compatibility issues with Bun.

## ⚙️ Technical Changes

- **Asset Pipeline**: Moved fonts and branding images to `src/lib/` for optimized bundling and content hashing.
- **Manifest Sync**: Updated `site.webmanifest` with brand-aligned theme and background colors.
- **Prerender Strategy**: Added `+layout.ts` with forced prerendering to ensure `index.html` generation for static hosts.

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- In rare cases, the Tiny5 font may require a manual refresh on the first load in specific Safari versions.
