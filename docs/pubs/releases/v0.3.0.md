# Release Notes: v0.3.0 (The Modular Artisan)

This major release transforms the **Rupa Pixel Editor** into a professional-grade workspace with a completely refactored architecture, intuitive selection mechanics, and a refined HUD designed for serious craftsmanship.

## 🚀 Highlights

### 1. Architectural Evolution (SOC)
The engine has been entirely rebuilt following the **Separation of Concerns (SOC)** principle.
- **Modular State:** `AtelierState` is now a root orchestrator delegating to specialized sub-states: `Linen`, `Needle`, `Palette`, `Studio`, `Project`, and `Selection`.
- **Service-Oriented Logic:** Core logic moved into dedicated services for Movement, Stitching, Manipulation, Clipboard, and Persistence.

### 2. Enhanced Selection (Looming)
The "Digital Stitching" workflow is now much more powerful:
- **Persistent Selection:** Active regions now stay visible after releasing the Shift key.
- **Marching Ants UI:** A dynamic, animated lasso border provides professional visual feedback.
- **Batch Fill:** Press `Space` while selecting to instantly fill the region with the active dye.
- **Grouped History:** Paste, Cut, and Batch Fill operations are now grouped into single Undo/Redo entries.

### 3. Navigation & Precision
- **Go To Coordinate (G):** A new direct-jump feature allows you to move the Needle to exact Cartesian coordinates.
- **Data Integrity:** Fully separated "Empty Stitches" from the "Studio Cream" color using `null` data values. You can now use `#eee8d5` as a valid dye in your artwork.

### 4. HUD Overhaul
The interface has been restructured into specialized Bars for a cleaner workspace:
- **TopBar:** Centralized command center for project tools.
- **LeftBar:** Floating floating color palette.
- **RightBar:** Unified **Dye Inspector** (Active & History) and Needle Stats.
- **BottomBar:** Floating State Indicator with 20-second autohide.

### 5. Smart SVG Artifacts
The export engine now uses a **Greedy Rect-Merging** algorithm. It intelligently combines connected stitches of the same color into optimized paths, significantly reducing SVG file complexity and size.

## 🛠 Improvements
- **Refined Aesthetics:** Softened UI with consistent `rounded-xl/2xl` corners.
- **Slimmer HUD:** Optimized padding and gaps for `NeedleStats` and `DyeInspector`.
- **Terminology Sync:** Formalized the use of **Stitch** (Pixel), **Motif** (Shape), and **Swatch** (Clipboard).
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Overhauled Specs, Architecture, and User Guide.

## ⚙️ Technical Changes
- **Svelte 5 Deep Integration:** Leveraging fine-grained reactivity with `$state` and `$derived` runes across all new modules.
- **Modular Components:** Every UI element, no matter how small, is now encapsulated in its own file.

*"Happy weaving in your newly refined Atelier."*
