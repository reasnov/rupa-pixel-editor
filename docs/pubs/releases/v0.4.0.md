# Release Notes: v0.4.0 (The Resonant Artisan)

This release focuses on atmosphere, professional-grade ergonomics, and self-documenting craftsmanship. The Atelier is now not just a tool, but a meditative instrument that grows with the artisan.

## 🚀 Highlights

### 1. Professional Workspace Layout
Transitioned from a "floating bar" UI to a structured, container-based workspace similar to industry-standard design tools like Figma.
- **Atelier Header**: Unified command center for tools and project identity.
- **Folio Sidebar (Left)**: Dedicated space for project structure (Frames & Veils) with **Drag-and-Drop** support.
- **Inspector Sidebar (Right)**: Consolidated property panels for Dye management and Needle precision.
- **TechLedger**: A modular status bar tracking chords, stances, and session metrics.

### 2. The Atmosphere Protocol (Ambient Piano)
Introduced a generative background music engine that produces real-time, meditative piano compositions.
- **Eb Major Pentatonic**: Composed using harmonically safe scales for a dreamy atmosphere.
- **Session-Aware Playback**: The studio remains silent for the first 30 minutes of deep focus, then gradually weaves in the melody over the next 30 minutes.
- **Procedural Performance**: Notes are generated on-the-fly, ensuring a unique and never-ending performance.

### 3. Audio Basin & Customization
A new interface for tuning the studio's resonance.
- **Independent Volume Control**: Separated sliders for Stitch Resonance (SFX) and Ambient Piano (BGM).
- **Musical Palettes**: Selecting colors (1-0) now plays a resonant C Major scale (Doremi), adding a taktile musical layer to the drawing process.

### 4. The Artisan's Codex (User Guide)
A comprehensive, in-app guide accessible via **F1** or **Ctrl + ?**.
- Rupa's philosophy and terminology are now built directly into the studio.
- Automatically welcomes new artisans after the splash screen.

## 🛠 Improvements
- **Layer Reordering**: Move Veils (layers) using shortcuts `[` and `]` or by dragging them in the Folio Sidebar.
- **Artifact Preview**: A large, real-time live preview window in the **Artifact Crate** (Export) to verify scaling and transparency.
- **Extended Pattern Catalog**: All new studio actions (Audio settings, Codex, Transformations) are now searchable.
- **Shortcut Safety**: Documented and implemented a list of "Reserved Shortcuts" to avoid collisions with OS/Browser controls.

## ⚙️ Technical Changes
- **Modular TechLedger**: Indicators are now encapsulated sub-components.
- **Precise Timer**: Implemented a per-second session tracker for the Atmosphere Protocol.
- **Z-Index Layering**: Optimized overlay depth to ensure color pickers always appear on top of settings.
