# Release Notes: v0.5.0 (The Spindle of Time)

This milestone release transforms **Rupa Studio** from a static pixel editor into a professional kinetic workshop. It introduces the **Spindle Engine** for motion editing, an architectural standard for CSS, and comprehensive UI/UX guidelines to ensure the studio remains a meditative sanctuary for artisans.

## 🎞️ Kinetic Mode (The Spindle Engine)

The studio now supports temporal sequences, allowing artisans to breathe life into their stitches.

### 1. Professional Linear Timeline

- **The Spindle**: A completely redesigned, modular timeline track.
- **Linear Track**: Frame blocks are now continuous segments whose width represents their duration.
- **Time Ruler**: Accurate millisecond markers to help time your animations.
- **The Playhead**: A magenta "Needle of Time" that indicates the active frame position.

### 2. Ghost Threads (Onion Skinning)

- **Visual Shadow**: Visualize up to 2 previous frames with graded transparency.
- **Shortcut**: `Alt + G` to toggle ghosts on/off.
- **Intuitive HUD**: A quick-toggle button is now available directly on the Spindle panel.

### 3. Kinetic Weaves (Video Export)

- **Advanced Export**: Create artifacts in **WebM**, **MP4**, **GIF**, and **Animated SVG** formats.
- **Safety Protocol**: Kinetic formats are automatically disabled for single-frame projects to prevent errors.

## ⌨️ Workflow & Shortcuts

Master the studio with a more intuitive and powerful keyboard-centric interface.

### 1. Improved Manipulations

- **Duplicate (Frame/Veil)**: `Ctrl + D`
- **Delete (Frame/Veil)**: `Alt + D`
- **Folio Navigation**: Use `Alt + 1` to focus Frames and `Alt + 2` to focus Veils.

### 2. Structural History (Undo/Redo)

- Every structural change—adding frames, deleting layers, or reordering veils—is now fully recorded in the **History Ledger**. You can now undo/redo entire folio manipulations with confidence.

## 🏗️ Architectural Foundations

### 1. SMACSS CSS Pattern

- The studio now officially follows the **SMACSS** (**S**calable and **M**odular **A**rchitecture for **CSS**) standard. This ensures the Cottagecore aesthetic remains maintainable as the project scales.

### 2. UI/UX Artisan Guide

- A new [**UI/UX Handbook**](../../developers/ui-ux.md) has been established to define the principles of meditative, cozy, and game-like experiences in Rupa.

## 🛠 Improvements & Refinements

- **Visual Harmony**: The Spindle panel has been re-skinned to align with the **Solarized Cream** and **Artisan Magenta** palette, moving away from aggressive dark tones.
- **Service-Oriented Logic**: Core folio logic has been moved to the `FolioService`, ensuring a strict Separation of Concerns.
- **Performance**: Optimized ghost frame rendering using grid-column positioning to minimize DOM pressure.
