# Release Notes: v0.6.0 (The Logic of Loom)

This milestone introduces geometric intelligence to **Rupa Studio**, empowering artisans to create perfect shapes with minimal effort. This release also formalizes the 5-layer architecture for long-term scalability and integrates global i18n & A11y standards.

## ✨ Quick Shape Correction (Hold-to-Snap)

A drawing mechanism inspired by professional design tools, now available in the pixel art ecosystem.

### 1. Geometric Snapping
- **Hold-to-Snap**: Hold the pointer for 600ms at the end of a stroke to automatically transform rough sketches into perfect straight lines, arcs, or circles.
- **Perfect Circles**: Utilizes the *Midpoint Circle Algorithm* to guarantee 100% pixel symmetry for circular forms.
- **Axis Locking**: Automatically snaps lines to Horizontal, Vertical, or Diagonal (45°) axes when the stroke approaches those angles.

### 2. High-Performance Rendering
- **Batch Stitching**: Entire strokes are now processed as a single *Atomic Action*, optimizing DOM reactivity and simplifying the Undo/Redo system.
- **SVG Pointer Track**: An ultra-lightweight visual pointer track with *Marching Ants* animation for smooth real-time feedback.
- **Bresenham Interpolation**: Ensures gapless pixel connectivity even during high-speed pointer movements.

## 🏗️ Architecture: The Logic Layer

Introducing the 5th layer in our **Modular Layered Monolith** architecture.

- **Logic Layer (`src/lib/logic/`)**: A pure library for mathematical calculations and complex algorithms (Geometry & Path processing).
- **Stateless Brain**: Decouples computational logic from the application state, ensuring algorithms can be tested and reused modularly.

## 🌍 Global Standards & Inclusivity

The studio is now ready to embrace artisans from all over the world.

- **Global Craft (i18n)**: Full integration of `i18next` with the global `__()` function. All UI text is now centralized and ready for localization.
- **Inclusive Studio (A11y)**: Implementation of ARIA standards, improved focus management, and visual contrast adhering to WCAG AA guidelines.
- **Human-centric Copy**: Refreshed narratives in the *SplashScreen* and *Artisan Codex* to feel warmer and more inviting.

## 🛠 Improvements & Refinements
- **Unified Pulse**: Consolidated the timing system into `ChronosEngine` for animation stability.
- **Safety ESC**: The `Escape` key is now prioritized to instantly cancel an active stroke.
- **Stabilization Slider**: Line correction sensitivity control is now available in *Linen Settings*.
