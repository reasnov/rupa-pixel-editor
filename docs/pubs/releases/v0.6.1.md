# Release Notes: v0.6.1 (The High-Performance Linen)

This patch focuses on radical performance optimization and a refined visual experience for the **Linen Viewport**. By migrating the core rendering from DOM to HTML5 Canvas, the studio is now capable of handling large-scale compositions with zero latency.

## 🚀 The Canvas Migration (Performance Revolution)

We have transformed how pixels are woven in the studio, moving away from individual DOM elements to a centralized high-performance rendering system.

### 1. HTML5 Canvas Rendering
- **Main Linen**: The primary grid is now rendered via a single HTML5 Canvas element. This reduces the DOM overhead by thousands of nodes, ensuring smooth 60s interaction even on 128x128 canvases.
- **Ghost Threads (Onion Skinning)**: Frame transparency for animation is now also Canvas-based, allowing for multiple layers of "onion skinning" without memory penalty.
- **SVG Selection Path**: The *Selection Lasso* now uses a single SVG `<path>` for area highlights, eliminating thousands of `div` elements during complex motif manipulation.

## 📏 The Adaptive Pixel Ruler

A complete overhaul of the **LinenRuler** (Pixel Ruler) for better readability and precision.

- **Adaptive Intervals**: Labels now dynamically adjust their density based on zoom level (switching between 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 units) to stay clear at all scales.
- **GPU-Accelerated Ticks**: Ticks and markers are now rendered using CSS repeating-linear-gradients, reducing the CPU load for ruler drawing.
- **Needle Sync**: The *Needle Highlight* is now mathematically unified with the ruler's coordinate space, ensuring pixel-perfect alignment across all device aspect ratios.
- **Artisan Layout**: Vertical labels are now rotated -90°, and all markers are "half-length" for a cleaner, more professional look.

## ✨ UI/UX & Navigation Refinements

- **Normalized Zoom**: 100% zoom now fills the viewport optimally, removing the hardcoded 50% scale limitation.
- **Slim TechLedger**: Reduced the vertical footprint of the *Status Footer* and condensed the *TechLedger* to maximize the creative workspace.
- **Escape Mastery**: Fixed an issue where the `Escape` key wouldn't close modals, ensuring a consistent "Back-to-Loom" experience.

## 🏗️ Architectural Integrity
- **Centralized Fitting**: Viewport fitting logic moved from UI components to `LinenState` (State Layer), ensuring a Single Source of Truth for linen dimensions.
- **Needle Overlay**: Decoupled the *Needle* from individual pixels, rendering it as a high-precision DOM overlay on top of the Canvas grid.
