# Release Notes: v0.7.0 (Industrial Precision & Refined Layers)

This major release focuses on aligning the technical foundation of **Rupa Pixel Editor** with industry standards while introducing advanced layer management and performance optimizations. We have completed a comprehensive refactoring of the internal "machinery" to ensure long-term maintainability.

## 🏗️ Technical Realignment (The Industrial Shift)

We have decoupled the unique "Barista" user experience from the technical implementation. While the UI remains a meditative café, the code now speaks the language of professional software engineering.

### 1. Standardized Engine Architecture
The core engines have been renamed to reflect their technical responsibilities:
- **KeyboardEngine**: Previously RhythmEngine, now the unified handler for ActionIntents.
- **InputEngine**: Previously SynapseEngine, normalizes signals from all physical devices.
- **ServiceCoordinator**: Previously ShuttleEngine, provides a clean API for complex operations.
- **AnimationEngine**: Previously ChronosEngine, orchestrates temporal sequences.
- **PixelEngine**: Previously FiberEngine, handles high-performance pixel math.
- **ColorEngine**: Previously SpinnerEngine, manages color conversions and adjustments.
- **FeedbackEngine**: Previously ResonanceEngine, orchestrates sensory feedback (SFX/Haptics).

### 2. Hierarchical Data Integrity
Standardized terminology across all internal data structures:
- **Frames**: Technical term for "Cups".
- **Layers**: Technical term for "Infusions".
- **Pixels**: Technical term for "Etches".
- **Project**: Technical term for "Recipe Book".

## 🧵 Refined Layering & Selection

Advanced features for managing complex pixel art compositions.

### 1. Merge Layers (Merge Down)
Users can now permanently combine the active Layer with the one directly below it. This operation uses a professional painter's algorithm to preserve transparency and is fully integrated with the Undo/Redo system.

### 2. Optimized Selection Masking
Drawing and erasing now respect the active selection with zero latency. By implementing a derived $O(1)$ lookup set for selected indices, we've eliminated iteration overhead during high-speed drawing.

## ✨ Internal Improvements

- **Documentation Sync**: All blueprints, architecture guides, and technical specifications have been rewritten to match the new technical terminology.
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Resolved legacy type mismatches and duplicate identifiers in the HUD components.
- **Improved Test Suite**: Added comprehensive tests for layer merging and updated existing tests to verify masking behavior.
