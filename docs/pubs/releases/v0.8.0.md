# Release Notes: v0.8.0 (The Master Etcher)

This major release introduces the **Master Etcher's Kit**, a suite of professional-grade drawing and precision tools designed to accelerate complex pixel art creation while maintaining the meditative "Digital Brewing" experience.

## 🚀 Highlights: The Master Etcher's Kit

### 1. Dynamic Brush Dynamics (The Grinder)

Moving beyond the 1x1 atomic placement, the studio now supports variable brush sizes and shapes.

- **Variable Size:** Adjust brush diameter from 1px to 5px using **`[`** and **`]`**.
- **Brush Shapes:** Toggle between **Square** (precise) and **Circle** (organic) vessels using **`Alt + B`**.
- **Pattern Brush:** Load any copied swatch as a custom brush tip using **`Ctrl + Alt + B`** for repeating motifs.

### 2. Mirror Symmetry & Tiling (The Infinite Weave)

Advanced environment modifications for balanced and repeating patterns.

- **Mirror Symmetry:** Toggle Horizontal, Vertical, and Quadrant symmetry with **`S`**, guided by dashed Barista Magenta axes.
- **Seamless Tiling:** Enable coordinate wrapping with **`T`**, featuring a high-performance reactive 3x3 mirrored preview.

### 3. Geometric Vessels & Gradients (Structural Pouring)

Keyboard-centric creation of shapes and smooth color transitions.

- **Shape Tools:** Create precise Rectangles (**`Alt + R`**) and Ellipses (**`Alt + C`**) using the etcher's focus.
- **Ombre Pour:** Create smooth linear gradients between two points using **`Alt + G`**.

### 4. Professional Shading & Purity (The Roast)

Add depth and maintain clean lines with automated assistance.

- **Shading Modifiers:** Hold **`L`** (Lighten), **`D`** (Darken), or **`X`** (Dither) to shade existing pixels in real-time.
- **Pure Pour:** Toggle **Pixel-Perfect** lines with **`Shift + P`** to eliminate redundant corner pixels automatically.

### 5. Kinetic Transformation & Locking

- **Focus Transformation:** Nudge selected pixels directly with arrow keys by entering Transform mode (**`M`**).
- **The Seal:** Protect your work with **Alpha Lock (`A`)** and **Color Lock (`Shift + A`)**.

## 🛠 Improvements & Refinements

- **Artisan (Technical) Terminology:** Updated the entire studio to display dual-labels (e.g., "Infusion (Layer)"), helping new users bridge the creative metaphor with industry standards.
- **Single Source of Truth (SSoT):** Automated the Shortcut Guide and Command Palette to dynamically reflect any changes in the configuration.
- **Industrial Reactivity:** Fixed critical issues where large-scale manipulations (Flip, Rotate, Paste, Fill) required a manual refresh to render.
- **Shortcut Conflict Resolution:**
  - **Infusion (Layer) Reordering** moved to **`Alt + [`** and **`Alt + ]`**.
  - **Recolor All** moved to **`Alt + H`**.
  - **Jump to Coordinate** moved to **`Alt + J`**.
  - **Onion Skinning** moved to **`Alt + O`**.
- **Visual Polish:** Replaced default browser focus rings with a brand-compliant **Magenta Glow** specifically for the canvas.

## ⚙️ Technical Changes

- **5-Layer Integrity:** Expanded the **Logic Layer** with `BrushLogic` and `PixelLogic` for stateless mathematical transformations.
- **Performance Engine:** Implemented `putImageData` rendering and a specialized color cache for zero-latency drawing at high frequencies.
- **Code Quality:** Fully resolved all `svelte-check` diagnostics and accessibility warnings across the new toolset.
