# Release Notes: v0.8.0 (The Master Etcher)

This major release introduces the **Master Etcher's Kit**, a suite of professional-grade drawing and precision tools designed to accelerate complex pixel art creation while maintaining the meditative "Digital Brewing" experience.

## 🚀 Highlights: The Master Etcher's Kit

### 1. Dynamic Brush Dynamics (The Grinder)

Moving beyond the 1x1 atomic placement, the studio now supports variable brush sizes and shapes.

- **Variable Size:** Adjust brush diameter from 1px to 5px using **`[`** and **`]`**.
- **Brush Shapes:** Toggle between **Square** (precise) and **Circle** (organic) vessels using **`Alt + B`**.
- **Visual Feedback:** The Cursor now dynamically scales to show the "splash zone" of your pour.

### 2. Mirror Symmetry (Reflective Brewing)

Create perfectly balanced characters and patterns with the new real-time reflection engine.

- **Symmetry Modes:** Toggle through Horizontal, Vertical, and Quadrant (4-way) symmetry by pressing **`S`**.
- **Interactive Guides:** Dashed Barista Magenta lines appear on the active axes to guide your rhythm.

### 3. Professional Shading (The Roast)

Add depth, highlights, and shadows without changing your active flavor.

- **Light Roast:** Hold **`L`** while moving to brighten existing pixels by 10%.
- **Dark Roast:** Hold **`D`** while moving to darken existing pixels by 10%.
- **Texture (Dither):** Hold **`X`** while moving to apply a classic checkerboard pattern.
- **Workflow:** These modifiers automatically enter **PAINT** mode for a seamless shading flow.

### 4. Infinite Pour (Seamless Tiling)

A specialized environment for creating repeating patterns and game textures.

- **Coordinate Wrapping:** Enable with **`T`** to allow the Etcher to wrap around canvas boundaries.
- **Tiled Preview:** Displays a reactive 3x3 mirrored grid in the background to visualize connections in real-time.

### 5. Advanced Pixel Protection (The Seal)

- **Alpha Lock:** Toggle with **`A`** to only affect non-transparent pixels.
- **Color Lock:** Toggle with **`Shift + A`** to only affect pixels matching the color under your Etcher.

## 🛠 Improvements & Refinements

- **Industrial Reactivity:** Fixed a critical issue where large-scale manipulations (Flip, Rotate, Paste, Fill) didn't render instantly.
- **Shortcut Migration:**
  - **Infusion (Layer) Reordering** moved to **`Alt + [`** and **`Alt + ]`**.
  - **Sequence Prefix** for layers changed from `l` to **`i`** (e.g., `i,l` to lock) to prevent conflicts with Shading.
- **UI/UX Polish:**
  - Replaced the default browser focus ring with a professional **Barista Magenta ring** on the canvas.
  - Added the **Etching Indicator** to the status bar for real-time tool tracking.
  - Non-destructive UI actions (Lock/Hide Layer) no longer clutter the Undo/Redo stack.
- **Security Hardening:** Re-enabled Electron sandboxing for production builds while maintaining developer compatibility.

## ⚙️ Technical Changes

- **Logic Layer Expansion:** Introduced `BrushLogic` and expanded `PixelLogic` for stateless coordinate transformations.
- **Code Quality:** Migrated the i18n system to explicit imports for better traceability and testing.
- **Render Optimization:** Implemented `putImageData` and color caching for zero-latency high-frequency drawing.
