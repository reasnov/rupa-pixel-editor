# Project Overview: Rupa Pixel Editor

## 1. Vision & Identity

**Rupa Pixel Editor** is a professional-grade desktop application designed for creating pixel art through a meditative, keyboard-centric interface. Inspired by the **Cottagecore** lifestyle—the warmth of a hearth, the aroma of fresh coffee, and the intricate beauty of artisanal brews—Rupa offers a peaceful sanctuary for digital baristas.

Built with **Electron** and **Svelte 5**, the application treats the digital grid as a piece of fine foam, turning every pixel placement into a meaningful "drop" in a larger crema.

## 2. Core Philosophy: "The Barista's Brew"

Rupa embraces the slow, intentional pace of traditional crafts:

- **Barista Precision:** Every pixel is a deliberate drop, requiring a conscious movement of the "etcher" (the active cell).
- **Tactile Warmth:** Eliminates the cold, clinical feel of modern software in favor of a cozy, sun-drenched café atmosphere.
- **Rhythmic Workflow:** Encourages a flow state similar to brewing or etching, where the creator becomes attuned to the gentle "clicks" and "taps" of the craft.

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 The Barista's HUD

- **Etcher & Flow Navigation:** Full grid control using arrow keys, designed for the efficiency of a home-row barista.
- **Active Pixel Focus:** A soft, glowing etcher that tracks the current point of creation without the distraction of a floating mouse.

### 3.2 Flavor-Flow Mode

A signature feature for creating continuous patterns:

- **Streaming the Pour:** Hold a modifier key (e.g., `Ctrl`) to automatically color the path as the etcher moves, creating fluid lines across the foam.

### 3.3 Command Palette & Flavor Station

- **Universal Menu:** Press `Ctrl+K` to summon the Command Palette, a searchable directory of every action available in the café.
- **Natural Ingredient Palette:** A curated selection of earthy, botanical, and sunset tones for immediate use.
- **Flavor Station:** Access the keyboard-driven color picker to mix your own "flavors" with precision.

### 3.4 Serving the Artifacts

- **Pixel-Perfect PNG:** Serve your work with absolute sharpness at any scale.
- **Optimized SVG:** A vector format that intelligently merges pixels into efficient paths, perfect for blueprints or high-res printing.

## 4. UX Goals

- **Cottagecore Aesthetic:** A soft, painterly UI with paper textures, warm woods, and organic shapes.
- **Cozy Feedback:** Every interaction is accompanied by organic sounds—wooden taps, paper rustles, and soft chimes.
- **Distraction-Free Sanctuary:** A clean, peaceful environment that invites long, meditative sessions of digital crafting.
- **Inclusive Crafting:** A robust alternative for creators who prefer keyboard efficiency over traditional pointing devices.
- **Keyboard-Centric Design:** The primary workflow—from the first pixel to the final export—is optimized for the keyboard, though the mouse remains available for specific utility tasks.
